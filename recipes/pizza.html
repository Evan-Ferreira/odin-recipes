        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            a culinary dish made with a flattened base of leavened wheat-based
            dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and various other ingredients
            (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat,
            etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a
            wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, dissolve sugar in warm water. Sprinkle yeast
                over the top, and let stand for about 10 minutes, until foamy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in flour, salt, and olive oil. Beat until smooth. Let rest
                for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll
                into a round. Transfer crust to a lightly greased pizza pan or
                baker's peel dusted with cornmeal.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread pizza sauce over the crust. Top with cheese and your
                favorite toppings.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven at 475 degrees F (245 degrees C) for
                about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and
                the cheese is bubbly and melted.
            </li>
