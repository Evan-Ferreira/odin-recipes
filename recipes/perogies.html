        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A traditional Eastern European dish made with unleavened dough that
            is typically filled with a variety of ingredients such as potatoes,
            cheese, meat, or fruit. The filled dough is then boiled and often
            pan-fried before serving. Perogies are usually served with sour
            cream, onions, or bacon.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 cups mashed potatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely chopped onion</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. In a separate bowl, mix
                sour cream, eggs, and melted butter. Gradually add the wet
                ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.
                Knead the dough on a floured surface until smooth, then cover
                and let rest for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a mixing bowl, combine mashed potatoes, cheddar cheese, and
                chopped onion. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 1/8 inch
                thickness. Cut into circles using a cookie cutter or glass.
                Place a spoonful of the potato mixture in the center of each
                circle, fold the dough over, and press the edges to seal.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the perogies
                in boiling water until they float to the top, about 3 to 5
                minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Optional: Pan-fry the boiled perogies in a skillet with butter
                until golden brown on both sides. Serve with sour cream, saut√©ed
                onions, or bacon.
